# TypingTest

This is a simple typing test application that allows users to practice their typing skills by typing out randomly selected paragraphs. The application tracks the user's typing speed (WPM - Words Per Minute), the number of mistakes, and the number of characters typed correctly (CPM - Characters Per Minute).

## Project Structure


- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the typing test application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for the typing test, including loading paragraphs, tracking typing progress, and calculating WPM and CPM.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that contains the styles for the typing test application.

## Features

- Randomly selects a paragraph for the user to type.
- Tracks the time left, mistakes, WPM, and CPM.
- Highlights correct and incorrect characters as the user types.
- Allows the user to reset the test and try again.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Start typing the displayed paragraph in the input field.
4. The application will track your progress and display your typing speed, mistakes, and characters typed correctly.
5. Click the "Try Again" button to reset the test and load a new paragraph.
